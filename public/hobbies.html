    <h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Reading books:</h2>
        <p>As books are the greatest teachers, I believe in this philosophy. I recently read <b>Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl</b> and am currently reading <b>The Choice:Embrace the Possible by Dr. Edith Eger</b>. Both of these books are about the possibilities of human capability beyond our comprehension.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Exercise,running, and walking:</h2>
        <p>Exercising the body is a great way to increase mental toughness and develop discipline on a daily basis.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Reading Manga:</h2>
        <p>Reading manga gives me insight into the creative thinking of artists and an appreciation of the modern art of manga writing and story-telling.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Watching cricket and anime:</h2>
        <p>Watching cricket provides me with the importance of teamwork, as one selfish game can ruin the entire team's efforts. And anime provides me with the application of manga in creative videos.</p>
